1. set boolean constant for checkRep in my Graph ADT. The expensive version of checkRep() 
ensure there are no null keys and nulls values in graph with a complexity of O(n^2). 
It would slow down findPath() and loadGraph() a lot.

2. remove the contain edge check in the addEdge method when adding the edge to the set.
Because add method of set can return whether the addition is successful or not.
