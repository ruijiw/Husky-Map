 Node represents a vertex in one Graph. 
 Edge represents a connection between two Nodes. It has one parent node, one children node and a label. 
 Graph represents a collection of nodes and edges. Graph can be described by a map with nodes as keys 
 and lists of edges as values. A node matches to an edge if the edge contains the node as parent node. 

 Graph is a single class because only Graph would implement an interface if there is one. It's unnecessary
 to have an interface.
 
 I included following methods in my design:
 	isEmpty() would return whether a graph is empty. 
 	A client can use it to view whether the graph contains nodes.
 	
 	size() return the number of nodes in the graph.
 	
 	containNode(Node node) takes a Node as its parameter and return whether the Graph contains the specified node
 	
 	containEdge(Edge edge) takes a Edge as its parameter and return whether the Graph contains the specified edge
 	
 	addNode(Node node) adds a Node to the graph. A node would not be added if it is already in the graph. 
 	A client can use it to modify a graph by adding nodes.
 	
 	addEdge(Edge edge) adds an Edge to the graph and maps it with its parent node. A edge would not be added 
 	if it is already in the graph or it has no corresponding parent node and children node. 
 	A client can use it to modify a graph by adding edges.
 	
 	removeNode(Node node) removes the Node from the Graph. A node would not be removed if it is not in the graph. 
 	A client can use it to modify a graph by removing nodes.
 		
 	removeEdge(Edge edge) removes an edge from the Graph. An edge would not be removed if it is not in the graph. 
 	A client can use it to modify a graph by removing edges.
 	
 	getNodeSet() returns a set containing all the Nodes in the graph. 
 	A client can view the node set but not modify it.
 	
 	getModifiableNodeSet() returns a set containing all the Nodes in the graph. 
 	A client can view the node set and modify it.
 	
 	getEdgeSet(Node node) returns a set containing edges with the specified node as parent node.
 	A client can view the edge set but not modify it.
 	
 	getModifiableEdgeSet(Node node) returns a set containing edges with the specified node as parent node.
 	A client can view the edge set and modify it.
 		
 	getEdgeSets() returns a set containing all the Edges in the graph. 
 	A client can view the edge set but not modify it.
