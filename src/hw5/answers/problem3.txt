The strategy of most of my tests are clear-box because I modify the test suites a lot after checking the actual source code. 
I start the test from the black box test, but I add lots of edge cases or special situations afterwards. 

My implementation test is mostly unit. I test the behavior of each method separately with different cases. For edge cases,
I test the behavior of Nodes and Edges with empty Strings, very long Strings and Strings with space, Strings with integer, 
Strings with double are tested. For special situation, I test the situation that adding an edge whose children node or parent 
node or both is not in the graph. I test adding duplicate edges and nodes and the edges with the same nodes but different label.

My specification test builds up from unit test and gradually leads to system test. The tests are creating graphs only,
adding nodes only, adding edges between two nodes, adding multiple edges, and creating multiple graphs.
