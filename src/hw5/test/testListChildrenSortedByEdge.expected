# Specification testing file for star war
# Tests that sort algorithm is correct

# Create the graph
created graph h

# Add multiple nodes
added node n to h
added node n1 to h
added node n2 to h
added node n3 to h

# Add an edge
added edge eZ from n to n1 in h
added edge eA from n to n1 in h
added edge e3 from n to n3 in h
added edge eA from n to n2 in h
added edge eJ from n to n2 in h
added edge eZ from n to n2 in h

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from n
the children of n in h are: n1(eA) n1(eZ) n2(eA) n2(eJ) n2(eZ) n3(e3)
