# Specification testing file.
# Tests that 6 graphs can be created, a 2 nodes for each
# graph an edge between them can be added, and the two nodes
# each graph can be printed


# Create graphs
created graph graph1
created graph graph2

# Add 2 nodes to each graph
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1
added node n1 to graph2
added node n2 to graph2
added node n1 to graph3
added node n2 to graph3
added node n1 to graph4
added node n2 to graph4
added node n1 to graph5
added node n2 to graph5
added node n1 to graph6
added node n2 to graph6
added node n1 to graph7
added node n2 to graph7

# Add an edge to each graph
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph2
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph3
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph4
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph5
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph6
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph7

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from n1
