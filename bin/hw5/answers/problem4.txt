My representation is an adjacency list. It is a map containing nodes and edges. The key of the map are nodes and 
the values of the map are sets of edges. Edges would be mapped to a key if the key is its parent node. 

I choose that representation because it is easy to get an out-going edge of a vertex, to insert an edge 
and lookup a vertex.

A collection of edges is easy to add and delete edges.

An adjacency matrix is easy to decide containNode and containEdge and to insert an edge.
