# Specification testing file.
# Tests that a graph can be created, a pair of nodes and
# multiple of edges between them can be added, and multiple
# edges can be printed out.


# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add a pair of nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1

# Add multiple edges
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e2 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e3 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e4 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e5 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e6 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e7 from n1 to n2 in graph1

# Print the outgoing edges from n1
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2(e1) n2(e2) n2(e3) n2(e4) n2(e5) n2(e6) n2(e7)
